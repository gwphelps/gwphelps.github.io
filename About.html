      I was born on January 1st, 1998 in Monmouth, IL. (I actually got a cash prize for being the first baby born in the county) I spent a few years living in various places in Minnesota before settling in St. Ansgar, IA, where I graduated from high school in 2016. I had an early interest in technology, doing First Lego League in 7-8 grade. My dad had noticed my interest in science and encouraged me from a young age to become an engineer. After watching a NOVA documentary on computers my senior year of High School, I decided to make my major Computer Engineering in order to learn more about how computers work.
