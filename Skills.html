<h2>Skills</h2>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>
Java was the language most of my Computer Science courses were taught in. Syntactically, it is the language I am most comfortable using, though I don't often use it when working on personal projects. If I were to do a coding/algorithm test I would do it in Java.
</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
In contrast to Java, I mostly use python for personal projects. I have used python for a number of applications. I have used:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>BeautifulSoup and Requests for web scraping. I made a script that gathers song lyrics and determines which ones have swear words. I also made a script to get data on NBA players from Basketball Reference.</li>
  <li>PIL for image processing. I made a script that uses a text file full of hex colors to "recolor" an image using only those colors.</li>
  <li>NLTK for natural language processing. I used NLTK in my senior design project to simplify English sentences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Node.js, React.js</h3>
<p>
Most of my experience developing web applications is in JavaScript, specifically Node.js for API calls. I used Express for setting up a Node.js REST server in my Libertas social media project, as well as my Snakesweepr game. I have some exposure to React.js as well, having made my snake battle personal project using React on the frontend.
</p>

<h3>C</h3>
<p>
C is the first programming language I learned in college. It was used in most of my Computer Engineering courses, such as Embedded Systems, Operating Systems, and Network Security. I am most comfortable writing C when using Linux operating systems.
</p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>
MySQL is the database management system I am most familiar with. I have used it as necessary in projects, and learned about it more in depth in my database class.
